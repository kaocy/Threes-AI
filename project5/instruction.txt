To make the sample program
$ make # see makefile for deatils

To enter the interactive shell
$ ./threes --shell

To enter the interactive shell, and set a game record dump file
$ ./threes --shell --save="stat.txt"

To enter the interactive shell, set a dump file, and initialize some agents
$ ./threes --shell --save="stat.txt" --play="some arguments..." --evil="some arguments..."

===================================================
To link the interactive shell with the arena server

First, check the IP address and the port of the arena server, here we assume that it is 140.113.86.124:32768
$ chmod +x arena-link arena-ctrl # make the scripts executable
$ ./arena-link 140.113.86.124:32768 ./threes --shell --save="stat.txt" --play="some arguments..." --evil="some arguments..."

However, it is recommended to wrap the complete shell command "./threes --shell ..." with another script file.
For example, create a new script file "run.sh" whose content is
#!/bin/bash
./threes --shell --save="stat.txt" --play="some arguments..." --evil="some arguments..." --arguments...

Now you can use the wrapper to launch your program
$ chmod +x run.sh # make the script executable
$ ./arena-link 140.113.86.124:32768 ./run.sh

Two messages will be displayed once the arena-link starts
arena-link: 140.113.86.124:32768 <--> ./run.sh
arena-ctrl: ./arena-link-20181217013439562

The second line indicates the control panel of this session
To active the control panel, you need another terminal in the same working directory
$ ./arena-link-20181217013439562 # perform this operation in another terminal

Once the control panel is activated, you can send some data to the arena or your program.
To send something to the remote server, use the prefix "<< "
To send something to the local program, use the prefix ">> "

For example, if you want to open a match with other, and you do not write such a algorithm in your program's shell, use this command:
<< # open @UserName:@UserName
Or, if you want to terminate your shell normally with the built-in function exit, use this command:
>> @ exit
